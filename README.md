# Outlook Files Metabot
_A metabot for working with Outlook MSG / EML files in Automation Anywhere._

## Features
- **Speed:** Uses the Outlook interop interface so is very fast (once Outlook is open)
- **Message Properties:** All common message properties available, including subject, date, body (text or HTML), sender and To (including Cc and Bcc) attributes.
- **Attachment Handling:** Iterate through attachments and retrieve the filename and size, and extract the file locally as required.

See the example TaskBot for how to use each property.

Built using Visual Studio 2017 and Automation Anywhere v10.7 (not yet tested in v11).
